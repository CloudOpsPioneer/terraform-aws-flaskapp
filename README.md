This repo demonstrates the different ways to deploy a web application on aws.
- [Running an app locally on ec2 instance](https://github.com/karthikrajkkr/terraform-aws-flaskapp/tree/main/app-ec2-local)
- [Running an app by running docker container locally on ec2 instance](https://github.com/karthikrajkkr/terraform-aws-flaskapp/tree/main/app-ec2-docker)
- [Running on ECS container](https://github.com/karthikrajkkr/terraform-aws-flaskapp/tree/main/app-ecs)
- [Running on EKS](https://github.com/karthikrajkkr/terraform-aws-flaskapp/tree/main/app-eks)

**Please Note:** This repo is only for learning purposes. I didn't implement modules for Terraform since I wanted to understand how the Terraform resources needed to be configured to deploy resources. For production deployment, You can check for modules in terraform documentation and implement them to deploy any AWS resources.<br>
